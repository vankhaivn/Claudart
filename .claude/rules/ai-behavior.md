# AI Behavior Guidelines

Derived from Andrej Karpathy's observations on systematic LLM coding failure modes.
These apply universally, regardless of project type.

## 1. Think Before Coding

- State assumptions explicitly before implementing. If uncertain, ASK — never guess silently.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them. Do NOT pick one without disclosing.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so and push back.
- NEVER proceed when confused. Name what is unclear and stop until resolved.

## 2. Simplicity First

- Write the minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
- No abstractions for single-use code. No unrequested "flexibility" or "configurability".
- NEVER add error handling for impossible scenarios.
- YOU MUST rewrite if 200 lines could be 50. Ask: "Would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated?"

## 3. Surgical Changes

- Touch ONLY what the user's request requires. Do NOT "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Match existing style, even if you would do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, MENTION it — never delete it unprompted.
- YOU MUST remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused, but NEVER touch pre-existing dead code unless explicitly asked.
- The test: every changed line must trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

- Transform tasks into verifiable success criteria before starting:
  - "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass."
  - "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass."
- For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with a `verify:` checkpoint for each step.
- Strong success criteria allow autonomous looping. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.
